= Conclusion and Next Steps

Congratulations! You've completed the *vLLM Playground Workshop*! 🎉

== What You've Learned

Throughout this workshop, you've gained hands-on experience with:

* ✅ Deploying and managing vLLM servers using Podman containers
* ✅ Interacting with LLMs through a modern chat interface with streaming responses
* ✅ Constraining AI outputs using structured output modes (JSON Schema, Regex, Grammar)
* ✅ Configuring tool calling to enable AI-driven function invocation
* ✅ Connecting MCP servers for agentic AI with human-in-the-loop approval
* ✅ Benchmarking and optimizing vLLM performance with GuideLLM

You now have the skills to build and deploy production-ready AI inference infrastructure using vLLM / RHAIIS.

== Your Journey with ACME Corporation

|===
|Module |Challenge |Solution

|*Module 1*
|Needed to evaluate AI inference options
|Deployed vLLM Playground with GPU-accelerated inference

|*Module 2*
|AI responses were unpredictable for backend integration
|Implemented structured outputs for consistent, parseable responses

|*Module 3*
|AI couldn't take actions or retrieve data
|Configured tool calling for intelligent function invocation

|*Module 4*
|Required real-time data access with safety controls
|Connected MCP servers with human-in-the-loop approval

|*Module 5*
|Needed to validate production readiness
|Benchmarked and optimized for target throughput and latency

== Key Takeaways

The most important concepts to remember:

. **vLLM is the industry-leading inference engine**: High-performance, production-ready LLM serving with continuous batching and efficient memory management.

. **Structured outputs enable reliable AI integration**: JSON Schema, Regex, and Grammar modes transform unpredictable AI text into system-ready data.

. **Tool calling bridges AI and actions**: The AI generates function calls; your systems handle execution—a powerful pattern for automation.

. **MCP provides safe agentic capabilities**: Human-in-the-loop approval ensures you maintain control while enabling AI to access external tools.

. **Performance testing is essential**: Benchmark before production to validate throughput, latency, and capacity requirements.
