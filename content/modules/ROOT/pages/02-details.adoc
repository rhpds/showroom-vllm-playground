* SSH access: `{ssh_command}`
* vLLM Playground web UI: http://{hostname}:7860
* Pre-installed vLLM Playground CLI

=== Network requirements

* Internet connectivity for downloading container images from registry
* Access to HuggingFace for model downloads (if using gated models)
* Lab host network access (specific URLs provided in lab interface)

== Environment setup

=== Pre-configured for you

Your lab environment comes with:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Component |Status

|vLLM Playground v0.1.1
|✓ Pre-installed via pip

|Podman
|✓ Pre-installed and configured

|NVIDIA GPU drivers
|✓ Pre-configured with CUDA

|Python 3.10+
|✓ Available for MCP support

|Container images
|✓ Will be pulled during exercises
|===

=== Setup validation

Run these commands to verify your environment:

[source,bash]
----
# Verify vLLM Playground installation
vllm-playground --help

# Verify Podman
podman version

# Verify GPU availability
nvidia-smi

# Check Python version (for MCP)
python3 --version
----

== Troubleshooting guide

=== Common setup issues

**Problem**: "vllm-playground: command not found"
→ **Solution**: Verify the installation path is in your PATH, or run with full path

**Problem**: "Permission denied" when running Podman commands
→ **Solution**: Ensure you're using rootless Podman or have appropriate permissions

**Problem**: "NVIDIA driver not found" or GPU not detected
→ **Solution**: Verify NVIDIA drivers are installed with `nvidia-smi`

**Problem**: "Container image pull fails"
→ **Solution**: Check network connectivity and ensure you have access to container registries

**Problem**: "Port 7860 already in use"
→ **Solution**: Run `vllm-playground stop` to stop any existing instance, or use `--port` to specify a different port

=== During workshop support

* Check the vLLM Playground logs: `podman logs vllm-service`
* Verify server status: `vllm-playground status`
* Restart if needed: `vllm-playground stop && vllm-playground`
