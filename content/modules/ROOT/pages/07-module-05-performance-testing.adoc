:source-highlighter: rouge
:toc: macro
:toclevels: 1

Throughout this workshop, you've deployed vLLM servers, configured advanced inferencing features, and built agentic workflows. Now ACME Corporation faces the final question before production deployment: *Can this infrastructure handle real-world load?*

Before launching their AI-powered customer support system, ACME needs to validate that their vLLM deployment can handle expected traffic volumes with acceptable latency. GuideLLM is a performance benchmarking tool designed specifically for LLM inference servers, providing insights into throughput, latency, and resource utilization.

In this final module, you'll benchmark your vLLM server and learn to optimize configuration for production workloads.

== Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

* Understand LLM inference performance metrics and their business impact
* Install and configure GuideLLM for vLLM benchmarking
* Run load tests with different request patterns
* Analyze throughput, latency, and token generation metrics
* Optimize vLLM server configuration based on benchmark results

=== What is GuideLLM?

GuideLLM is a benchmarking tool that:

* Generates realistic LLM workloads
* Measures inference performance metrics
* Supports sweep testing (varying request rates)
* Provides detailed analysis and reports
* Integrates with vLLM's OpenAI-compatible API

=== Prerequisites

* Module 1 completed (vLLM server running)
* SSH access to lab environment
* vLLM Playground with running server

=== Steps

. Connect to your lab environment:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
{ssh_command}
----

. Install GuideLLM:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo pip install guidellm
----
+
Alternatively, if you installed vLLM Playground with benchmarking support:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo pip install vllm-playground[benchmark]
----

. Verify the installation:
+
[source,bash]
----
guidellm --help
----
+
Expected output:
+
----
Usage: guidellm [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  GuideLLM CLI for benchmarking, preprocessing, and testing language models.

  --version  Show the version and exit.
  --help     Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  benchmark    Run a benchmark or load a previously saved benchmark report.
  config       Show configuration settings.
  mock-server  Start a mock OpenAI/vLLM-compatible server for testing.
  preprocess   Tools for preprocessing datasets for use in benchmarks.
----

. Restart the vLLM Playground daemon service so that GuideLLM can be detected:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo systemctl restart vllm-playground
----
+
NOTE: The vLLM Playground service needs to be restarted after installing GuideLLM to detect the new benchmarking tools.

. Verify your vLLM Playground is running:
+
[source,bash]
----
vllm-playground status
----
+
Or, checking the daemon service:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo systemctl status vllm-playground
----

. Start a vLLM server with the Qwen model. In the vLLM Playground web UI, configure the following settings:
+
[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Setting |Value

|Model
|`Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct`

|Run Mode
|Container

|Compute Mode
|GPU
|===
+
Click *Start Server* and wait for the server to be ready. Monitor the *Server Logs* panel until you see the server is ready to accept connections.
+
NOTE: For performance benchmarking, we use a simple configuration without tool calling or MCP to get accurate baseline metrics.

. Check your vLLM server endpoint:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/models
----
+
This confirms the OpenAI-compatible API is accessible. Note the model name returned—you'll need it for benchmarking.
+

. Review server logs: `podman logs vllm-service`

[[exercise-2]]
== Exercise 2: Run benchmark and analyze performance metrics

Now you'll run your first benchmark and learn to interpret the results. ACME needs to understand their baseline performance before optimizing.

=== Steps

. In the vLLM Playground web UI, navigate to the *GuideLLM* panel in the sidebar.
+
image::module-05-figure-02.png[GuideLLM panel in vLLM Playground,width=700,title="GuideLLM Panel"]

. Select the *GuideLLM (Advanced)* radio button for Benchmark method.
+
NOTE: The *GuideLLM (Advanced)* option is only available after GuideLLM is installed. Without it, you can still use the built-in benchmark for basic performance testing.

. Configure the benchmark settings (defaults):
+
[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Setting |Value

|Total Requests
|`100`

|Request Rate (req/s)
|`5` (requests per second)

|Prompt Tokens
|`100`

|output Tokens
|`100`

|===

. Click *Run Benchmark* to start the benchmark.
+
This runs 100 requests at 5 request/second using 100 prompt tokens and 100 output tokens.
+
image::module-05-figure-03.png[GuideLLM benchmark in progress,width=700,title="Benchmark Running"]

. Wait for the benchmark to complete. You'll see progress indicators and then results in the UI.

. Review the benchmark results displayed in the panel. The GuideLLM panel provides three output formats:
+
[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Output Format |Description

|*Raw Output*
|The complete console output from GuideLLM, showing real-time progress and detailed logs

|*JSON*
|Structured JSON output for programmatic analysis and integration with other tools

|*Benchmark Summary Table*
|A formatted table displaying key performance metrics at a glance
|===
+
image::module-05-figure-04.png[GuideLLM benchmark results,width=700,title="Benchmark Results"]
+
The *Benchmark Summary Table* displays four key sections:
+
*Performance Metrics*::
Shows throughput statistics including Mean, Median, Min, and Max requests per second. For example:
+
[cols="1,1,1,1,1"]
|===
|Metric |Mean |Median |Min |Max

|Requests/Second
|4.33
|4.84
|0.00
|59.20
|===

*Token Statistics*::
Displays the token generation rate:
+
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Metric |Value

|Output Tokens/Second (Mean)
|448.40
|===

*Request Latency Percentiles*::
Shows latency distribution across different percentiles:
+
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Percentile |Latency (s) |Latency (ms)

|P50
|3.417
|3416.56

|P75
|3.498
|3497.91

|P90
|3.512
|3511.61

|P95
|3.518
|3517.99

|P99
|3.559
|3558.93
|===

. Understand each metric:
+
[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Metric |Interpretation

|**Requests/Second (Mean)**
|Average throughput - at 4.33 req/s, this server can handle ~260 requests per minute

|**Output Tokens/Second**
|448 tokens/s indicates the generation speed for responses

|**P50 Latency**
|Median latency - 50% of requests complete within 3.4 seconds

|**P90 Latency**
|90% of requests complete within 3.5 seconds

|**P99 Latency**
|99% of requests complete within 3.6 seconds (tail latency)
|===

=== Analyzing results for ACME's use case

ACME's customer support system requirements:

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Requirement |Target |Why

|TTFT
|< 500ms
|Users expect quick response start

|E2E (typical)
|< 3s
|Reasonable wait for support answers

|Throughput
|> 10 req/s
|Handle 100+ concurrent users with queuing
|===

Compare your benchmark results against these targets.

=== Verify

Confirm benchmarking works:

✓ Baseline benchmark completed successfully

✓ All key metrics (throughput, TTFT, E2E) are captured

✓ Sweep benchmark identifies maximum capacity

✓ Results saved for comparison

=== Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Benchmark requests failing

**Solution**:

. Check server logs: `podman logs vllm-service`
. Verify model is fully loaded
. Reduce request rate and retry

**Issue**: Very slow throughput

**Solution**:

. Verify GPU is being utilized: `nvidia-smi`
. Check model fits in GPU memory
. Consider a smaller model for testing

**Issue**: Out of memory errors

**Solution**:

. Reduce concurrent requests
. Lower `--gpu-memory-utilization` setting
. Use a smaller model

[[exercise-3]]
== Exercise 3: Optimize server configuration (Try it yourself)

Now that you understand how to run benchmarks, try optimizing the vLLM server configuration on your own to improve performance.

=== Key optimization parameters

The vLLM Playground UI provides several configuration options that affect performance:

[cols="1,1,2,2"]
|===
|UI Parameter |vLLM Flag |Effect |Trade-off

|*GPU Memory Utilization*
|`--gpu-memory-utilization`
|Higher values (0.9-0.95) allow more concurrent requests
|Too high may cause out-of-memory errors

|*Max Model Length*
|`--max-model-len`
|Maximum context length for requests
|Lower values free memory for more batching

|*Tensor Parallel Size*
|`--tensor-parallel-size`
|Distribute model across multiple GPUs
|Requires multiple GPUs available
|===

=== Walkthrough: How to optimize

. *Record your baseline* - Note the key metrics from Exercise 2 (Requests/Second, Output Tokens/Second, Latency percentiles)

. *Stop the current server* - Click *Stop Server* in the vLLM Playground UI

. *Adjust configuration* - Try changing one parameter at a time:
** Increase *GPU Memory Utilization* from 0.9 to 0.95
** Or decrease *Max Model Length* if your use case allows shorter contexts

. *Restart the server* - Click *Start Server* with the new configuration

. *Re-run the benchmark* - Use the same GuideLLM settings as Exercise 2

. *Compare results* - Did throughput improve? Did latency change?

=== Optimization strategies by use case

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Use Case |Recommended Approach

|*High throughput* (many concurrent users)
|Increase GPU memory utilization, accept slightly higher latency

|*Low latency* (real-time chat)
|Keep moderate memory utilization (0.85), prioritize fast response times

|*Long contexts* (document analysis)
|Higher max-model-len, fewer concurrent requests
|===

=== Your turn!

Try the following on your own:

. Stop the vLLM server
. Change one configuration parameter (e.g., GPU Memory Utilization to 0.95)
. Restart the server and run another benchmark
. Compare the results with your baseline

TIP: Keep notes on what changes you made and how they affected performance. This will help you understand the trade-offs for your specific use case.

=== Verify

✓ You understand the key optimization parameters

✓ You know how to modify server configuration in the UI

✓ You can run comparative benchmarks to measure improvements

== Troubleshooting

**Issue**: GuideLLM crashes during benchmark

**Solution**:

. Check available system memory
. Reduce `--max-requests` or `--rate`
. Update to latest GuideLLM version

**Issue**: Results vary significantly between runs

**Solution**:

. GPU thermal throttling—allow cooling between benchmarks
. Other processes competing for resources
. Run longer benchmarks for statistical stability

**Issue**: Can't achieve target performance

**Solution**:

. Current model may be too large for hardware
. Consider model quantization (INT8, INT4)
. Evaluate smaller, faster models for your use case
. Scale horizontally with multiple instances
